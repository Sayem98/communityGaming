        <h2>Want to Create Your Own Tournament?</h2>
        <p>
            Creating your own tournament takes less than 5 minutes. Create a
            tournament as small as 4 players and take advantage of the platform's
            auto pay technology. <br/><br/>
            For larger tournaments you can also earn an Organizer Fee. Organizers do
            a lot of work for their communities and should be incentivized to run
            great events.
